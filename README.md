## 🌟 Inspiration

When travelers visit Vietnam, they face two major challenges:

1. **Fear of Being Scammed** 💸
   Tourist traps are everywhere. Overpriced bills, fake "local" restaurants, and inflated prices for foreigners create anxiety and distrust. Many travelers end up paying 2-3x the fair price without even knowing it.

2. **Food Paralysis** 🤔
   Vietnamese cuisine is incredibly diverse with hundreds of regional dishes. Travelers don't know:
   - What dishes to try
   - How to eat them properly (phở, bánh xèo, nem rán...)
   - Which places are authentic vs tourist traps
   - How to communicate in restaurants when they don't speak Vietnamese

**The Result?** Travelers miss out on authentic experiences, waste money, and never truly discover the incredible food culture Vietnam has to offer.

**Phở.AI solves this.** We combine AI-powered computer vision, natural language processing, and local knowledge to give travelers superpowers in Vietnamese restaurants.

## 🚀 How We Built It

### Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 14 (App Router) with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shadcn/ui components
- React Webcam for camera integration

**AI & Vision:**
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash** for image analysis, OCR, and NLP
- Custom prompts for Vietnamese food expertise
- Multi-language translation pipeline

**Backend:**
- Next.js API Routes
- IndexedDB for client-side history/caching
- Image compression for performance

**Infrastructure:**
- Vercel for hosting
- OpenStreetMap Nominatim for geolocation
- Web Speech API for voice features

### Key Technical Achievements

1. **Smart Image Compression** - Automatically compresses images to 5MB while maintaining quality for AI analysis
2. **Offline History** - Uses IndexedDB to cache analysis results, saving API costs
3. **Multi-language Support** - Built i18n system supporting Vietnamese and English
4. **Responsive Camera** - Works on desktop, mobile, with file upload fallback
5. **Location-Aware Pricing** - Geolocation integration for accurate price estimates

---

## 💪 Challenges We Ran Into

### 1. Menu OCR Accuracy
Vietnamese menus often have:
- Handwritten text
- Mixed Vietnamese-English
- Low contrast photos
- Decorative fonts

**Solution:** Fine-tuned Gemini prompts with context about Vietnamese cuisine and tested with 50+ real menu photos.

### 2. Price Database
No existing API has Vietnamese street food prices by district.

**Solution:** Built prompts that leverage Gemini's training data on Vietnamese prices, combined with location context for accuracy.

### 3. Image Size Limits
Gemini API has 20MB limits, but phone photos are often 10-15MB.

**Solution:** Implemented smart compression using Canvas API that reduces size by 70% while preserving OCR quality.

### 4. Cross-Browser Voice Recognition
Web Speech API has inconsistent browser support.

**Solution:** Built fallback system with clear user guidance and browser detection.

### 5. Mobile Camera Access
HTTPS required for camera access in production.

**Solution:** Deployed on Vercel with automatic HTTPS, added file upload as backup.
